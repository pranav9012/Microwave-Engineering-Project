# Microwave-Engineering-Project
All the work is done in MATLAB. This projects includes the use of Z and ABCD Matrix, Image Impedance, Propagation factor, High Pass Filter and m-derived circuits.

**-----------------Part 1---------------------** \
Write a MATLAB code where you will be provided the Z values for a two port T- network 
initially as shown in Fig. below and thereby you have to calculate the ABCD matrix then 
image impedance and propagation factor using the Z parameters.

**-----------------Part 2---------------------** \
Now, design a high pass filter using the same pi- Network using inductors and capacitors. 
Plot the attenuation constant and phase constant in a single graph having some cut-off 
frequency as Ï‰c. Plot the graph.\
**--------------------------------------------**

**-----------------Part 3---------------------** \
Now modify the above circuit to an m-derived circuit to find out the value of attenuation 
constant and compare that with the attenuation constant for the previous filter for different 
values of m. Plot the graph.\
